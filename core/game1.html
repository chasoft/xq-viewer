[DhtmlXQ_comment0]mm xqjwms sw 02020101 Moving the king away||||Jim: This is the beginning of the second section of chapter 2. In the first section, how to defend against different combinations preparing to kill was discussed.||In section 2, how to actual resolve a check (not an impending check as in the previous section) is discussed. There are usually 5 ways to do this:||A) moving the king away from the line of fire||B) resolving the check and returning a check of your own (usually with a cannon)||C) attacking the chess piece(s) delivering the check||D) adding material in the line of fire such that the king is not threatened immediately||E) exchanging material such that the chess pieces are removed. ||Each of these situations are disccussed in this section.||||A) Moving the king away from the line of fire||Basic scenario: ||Your opponent is already delivering a check. If you do not resolve it, you lose. Its characteristics include:||i) your opponent is delivering an effective check.||ii) if the king does not move away, you would be left in severe trouble or lose.||||Things to take note off:||a) when you move your king away from the line of fire, it must actually defend your king||b) the place where you move your king to should deny the opponent any further chance of attack, allowing your king to be safe for the time being||c) if when you move your king, your opponent actually gets more chances to attack, then using material to block the check would be much better than letting your king run about aimlessly as it would not really be out of danger.||||Example, in this example, red is delivering a check with the central cannon AND chariot.[/DhtmlXQ_comment0]

[DhtmlXQ_comment11]And red would run out of consecutive checks. ||Black would now win instead. ||Jim: Red would have to play R2-8 to sacrifice his chariot to resolve this kill. Either way, red loses.[/DhtmlXQ_comment11]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]Mistake. ||Black has failed to see red's vicious kill.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_3]
[DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]Checkmate.||Jim: this happens to be a checkmate technique quite often seen in the ancient manual, "The Invincible XiangQi Manual" , which can also be seen on this site, under the ancient manuals section.[/DhtmlXQ_comment1_16]
